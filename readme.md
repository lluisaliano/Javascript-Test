# Async Queue Project

This project is a practice project that implements an asynchronous queue using JavaScript. The project is structured into two main parts: the `Structures` folder and the `Root` folder.

## Structures Folder

The `Structures` folder contains two JavaScript files: `Node.js` and `Queue.js`.

### Node.js

The `Node.js` file exports a `Node` class that represents a node in a queue. Each node has a value and a reference to the next node in the queue.

### Queue.js

The `Queue.js` file exports a `Queue` class that represents a queue. The queue has methods for pushing a value onto the end of the queue and shifting a value off the front of the queue.

## AsyncQueue.js

The `AsyncQueue.js` contains the main script that uses the `Queue` class to implement an asynchronous queue. The script includes methods for enqueuing and dequeuing values, closing the queue, and making the queue iterable asynchronously.

This project is a great way to practice and understand the concept of asynchronous programming in JavaScript. Enjoy coding!
